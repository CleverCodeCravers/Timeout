# Timeout

A timer application that will play a sound after a specified time is up.

## Requirements

- This is a console application.
- The application gets one command line parameter that is the duration of the timer in minutes.

1. The application will play the sound. (That is a test if the audio works properly. You might want to adjust your headphones.)
2. It will then show the remaining time in a loop (incl. seconds). The output will remain on one line so that the console output does not need to scroll.
3. When the time is up the application will play the sound again.
